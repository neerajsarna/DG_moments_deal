An input/output error has occurred. There are a number of reasons why this may be happening, both for reading and writing operations.

If this happens during an operation that tries to read data: First, you may be trying to read from a file that doesn't exist or that is not readable given its file permissions. Second, deal.II uses this error at times if it tries to read information from a file but where the information in the file does not correspond to the expected format. An example would be a truncated file, or a mesh file that contains not only sections that describe the vertices and cells, but also sections for additional data that deal.II does not understand.
